A Kubernetes multi-node cluster for developer of Kubernetes and projects that extend Kubernetes. Based on kubeadm and DIND (Docker in Docker).

Supports both local workflows and workflows utilizing powerful remote machines/cloud instances for building Kubernetes, starting test clusters and running e2e tests.

If you're an application developer, you may be better off with Minikube because it's more mature and less dependent on the local environment, but if you're feeling adventurous you may give kubeadm-dind-cluster a try, too. In particular you can run kubeadm-dind-cluster in CI environment such as Travis without having issues with nested virtualization.
